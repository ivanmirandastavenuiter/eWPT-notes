1. Read tips in Reddit, videos in youtube, search about how to take notes (especially regarding organization and structure)
    - Reddit does not have much info (try summarizing with Perplexity)
    - Youtube has nothing
2. Create prompts for Gemini based on these ideas to suggest most efficient ways of taking notes
    - Report done
    - Notes done
3. Investigate the best ways to efficiently take notes with those (advanced features for organization)
4. Decide which program to use for notes -> Obsidian
5. Stablish solid study plan. Select resources apart from tutorials: PortSwigger, Hack the Box, Try Hack Me. Create schedule.
    - Ask yourself now -> what do you need to know when you imagine yourself sat down in front of the PC and starting the exam?
        - What's the workflow? What are the steps?
