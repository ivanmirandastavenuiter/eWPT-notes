1. Read tips in Reddit, videos in youtube, search about how to take notes (especially regarding organization and structure)
    - Reddit does not have much info (try summarizing with Perplexity)
    - Youtube has nothing
2. Create prompts for Gemini based on these ideas to suggest most efficient ways of taking notes
    - Report done
    - Notes done
    - Doubts: 
        - Isn't too much one file per video? Wouldn't it mean too many files at the end? (**doing one file per course right now**)
        - Doubts for notes
            - How should I organize my notes?
            - What's the main content to include?
            - Should I focus more on the practical side (**Purpose** and **command** to achieve it)
        - The most important one: how should I approach the exam? 
            - Should I go with the WSTG? 
            - Should I pair each of the guide items with respective commands?
            - What are the core actions when gathering information, because I've seen from taking flags to capture snapshots. I need information on this.
            - The main problem is that the tutorials explains the *concept* but not the *methodology*. So everything goes good as long as you follow the instructions. But the day at the exam you need to read the room.
        - Which tools should I prepare for the exam:
            - Cheatsheet of commands?
            - Theory concepts?
            - What else?
3. Investigate the best ways to efficiently take notes with those (advanced features for organization)
4. Decide which program to use for notes: Notion, Obsidian
    - Does Obsidian accept markdown? I want to move my markdown notes to the program
5. Stablish solid study plan. Select resources apart from tutorials: PortSwigger, Hack the Box, Try Hack Me. Create schedule.
    - Ask yourself now -> what do you need to know when you imagine yourself sat down in front of the PC and starting the exam?
        - What's the workflow? What are the steps?
